Here are the clear, concrete use-cases for the SmartMirror + Replit Simulator app, broken down by audience and workflow.

✅ Primary Use Cases
1. Personalized Smart Mirror Experience (Face Recognition)

The system recognizes a person automatically and provides a dynamic, personalized experience.

Examples

Mirror greets a user by name on face match.

Mirror displays barber-specific or appointment-specific info.

Useful for barbershops, salons, gyms, boutiques, medical offices, spas, and retail.

2. Voice-Activated Control (No Touch UI)

The system responds to a hotword (“Mirror mirror…”) and understands commands.

Examples

“Detect face” → trigger recognition.

“New face” → start training a new user.

“Show messages” → bring up customer messages.

“Clear” → return to idle mode.

This supports hands-free operation in environments like shops or studios.

Shop owners or staff can send messages to the mirror from their phone.

Examples

"Your barber will be right with you."

This gives a simple remote admin dashboard without installing apps.
